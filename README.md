# PQLMF-performance
In this study, we compared the performance of PQLMF to 9 different Dimensionality reduction (DR) methods on 30 publicly available scRNAseq data sets that cover a range of sequencing techniques and sample sizes. The performance of different DR methods are evaluated in terms of their accuracy and robustness in both cell clustering and lineage reconstruction downstream analyses. The performance of different DR methods are evalued on both simulation data and real data.
